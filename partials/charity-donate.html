                <p class="paddingTop20">Welcome to The Center for Speech and Language Disorders. We are a non-profit organization with offices in Lombard and Chicago. Our mission is to help children with communication disorders reach their full potential through family centered services. CSLD's service delivery is set apart from its counterparts because each client benefits from an individualized relationship with their therapist. We recognize that one type of treatment does not fit all children, or all disorders. Each therapy plan is created based on the personal needs of the child and all therapeutic methods are research based and thus decisive and sound.</p>

                <p>We have a unique understanding of how speech and language skills change throughout a child's life. Early treatment might focus on the child's first words or their efforts to show their wants or needs. But as s/he grows older, CSLD helps the child use speech and language for telling stories, understanding concepts and academic learning.</p>

                <p>Please explore our site to learn more about CSLD, the children we serve, and how we can help you or someone you care about.  For further information on CSLD visit our website at <a href="http://www.csld.org">www.csld.org</a>.</p>
